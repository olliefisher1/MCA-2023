\[#Week 1 Tasks\]
## Task 1 - Theme for my dataset
Dataset: Pink Floyd - The Dark Side of The Moon
Musical scores:

## Task 2
Challenges to working with music and music related data:
- Subscriptions/pay to listen
- Differing scores
- Availability of rarities/different mixes or stems
- Algorithms only push what's popular and tend not to present you with older music or more obscure music
- Monopoly effect of streaming services means higher barrier to entry for listeners and content creators
How my theme displays some of these challenges:
- This album is from 1973, often it is not as accesible these days due to differences in technology and compatibility issues with modern technology
- Algorithms on streaming services will not push the music to new lsiteners, instead it is burid undernreath all of the currently popular music
- Since this is one of the most popular british albums, there is hundreds of interpretations and scores that may confuse a listener
