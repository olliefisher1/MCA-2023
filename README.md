## Task 1 - Theme for my dataset
My chosen dataset is the 1973 Album: The Dark Side of The Moon by british rock band Pink Floyd. At the time of the recording and release of this album, Pink Floyd were a 5 piece band consisting of David Gilmour on lead guitar and vocals, Roger Waters on bass guitar and lead vocals, Rick Wright on keyboard, piano, and backup vocals, and Nick Mason on the drums. This album is often regarded as one of the most important rock releases of the 70s as it blended the sounds of traditional rock music with the psychedelia movement prominent in the 60s, and is still referenced today as a seminal influence on the future of rock and roll music. Prior to release of this album Pink Floyd were part of the 1960s rock and psychedelic movement, this sound was mainly driven by the bands orignal main songwriter, guitarist, and singer: Sid Barrett. When Sid Barrett parted with the band in 1968, the sound began to evolve and develop into an arguably more commercial sound. By 1973, with the release of Dark Side of The Moon, the band had achieved wide commercial success, instilling their position as one of the main prominators of 1970's rock music. I chose this dataset because it is probably my favourite album of all time. Also, i can appreciate the musicianship and widespread appreciation and documentation of the album. Because of my personal interest, and the global analysis and documentation surrounding the album, I feel as though I can complete this well, delving into the notated, acoustic, and descriptive data. Providing input and analysis along the away.

## Task 2
Challenges to working with music and music related data:
- Subscriptions/pay to listen
- Differing scores
- Availability of rarities/different mixes or stems
- Algorithms only push what's popular and tend not to present you with older music or more obscure music
- Monopoly effect of streaming services means higher barrier to entry for listeners and content creators
How my theme displays some of these challenges:
- This album is from 1973, often it is not as accesible these days due to differences in technology and compatibility issues with modern technology
- Algorithms on streaming services will not push the music to new lsiteners, instead it is burid undernreath all of the currently popular music
- Since this is one of the most popular british albums, there is hundreds of interpretations and scores that may confuse a listener
