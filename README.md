## Task 1 - Theme for my dataset
My chosen dataset is the 1973 Album: The Dark Side of The Moon by british rock band Pink Floyd. At the time of the recording and release of this album, Pink Floyd were a 5 piece band consisting of David Gilmour on lead guitar and vocals, Roger Waters on bass guitar and lead vocals, Rick Wright on keyboard, piano, and backup vocals, and Nick Mason on the drums. This album is often regarded as one of the most important rock releases of the 70s as it blended the sounds of traditional rock music with the psychedelia movement prominent in the 60s, and is still referenced today as a seminal influence on the future of rock and roll music. Prior to release of this album Pink Floyd were mostly assosciated with the 1960s rock and psychedelic movement, this sound was mainly driven by the bands orignal main songwriter, guitarist, and singer: Sid Barrett. When Sid Barrett parted with the band in 1968, the sound began to evolve and develop into an arguably more commercial sound. The songwriting was tighter and more digestible, however 'trippy' lyrics were still a mainstay in their music and would remain as so until the end of the band. By 1973, with the release of Dark Side of The Moon, the band had achieved wide commercial success, instilling their position as one of the main prominators of 1970's rock music. I chose this dataset because it is probably my favourite album of all time. Also, i can appreciate the musicianship and widespread notoriety and documentation of the album. Because of my personal interest, and the global analysis and documentation surrounding the album, I feel as though I can complete my task well, delving into the notated, acoustic, and descriptive data surrounding it. Providing input and analysis along the away.

## Task 2 - Challenges that are faced when working with my chosen data set:

In the context of acoustic data. The album and all its songs can be found on all major subscription platforms, however this can introduce the challenges of paying to listen to the music. Of course, it is right that the artists get paid fairly for their creative contribution. However, with the monopoly that streaming services have over the music market, often artists are paid very little per listen. This leads to the consumer paying a high subscription fee without the artist receiving hardly any of that money.

In the context of notated data. I have found it significantly hard to access free and accurate musical scores. Since this is one of the most  albums of all time, there is plenty of musical scores out there however most of them are blocked by a paywall. Furthermore, many of the musical scores differ and suffer from inaccuracies in the actual notated music.

In the context of descriptive data. This can be found from a number of sources. A quick google search will tell you all the descriptive data about the album tht you would want to know. There is a wikipedia page on the album as well. Also, the band itself is notorious for its documentation of their musical journey, and have released their own information surroudning the album including statistics, and even a picture book documenting the recording, release and touring of the album, which they released on the 50th anniversary of the album.

- Subscriptions/pay to listen
- Differing scores
- Availability of rarities/different mixes or stems
- Algorithms only push what's popular and tend not to present you with older music or more obscure music
- Monopoly effect of streaming services means higher barrier to entry for listeners and content creators
How my theme displays some of these challenges:
- This album is from 1973, often it is not as accesible these days due to differences in technology and compatibility issues with modern technology
- Algorithms on streaming services will not push the music to new lsiteners, instead it is burid undernreath all of the currently popular music
- Since this is one of the most popular british albums, there is hundreds of interpretations and scores that may confuse a listener
